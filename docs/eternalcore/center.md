# 📖 Center Text with the `<center>` Tag

## ⚠ The `<center>` tag is not responsive and operates optimally under default interface settings.

## How to use
Here's the appropriate syntax of using the tag:

This syntax example represents a correct use of the tag:
```html
<gradient:#8091ff:#ff00bf><center>eternalcode.pl</center></gradient> // correct ✅
```

This syntax example represents an incorrect use of the `<center>` tag:
```html
<center><gradient:#8091ff:#ff00bf>eternalcode.pl</gradient></center> // incorrect ❌
```

In order for the `<center>` tag to function properly, remember to apply it only to a center-set text. It should not be
nested inside other tags. If additional stylization, such as gradient effects or colors, are required, implement these
properties outside the `<center>` tag, as demonstrated in the first example.
